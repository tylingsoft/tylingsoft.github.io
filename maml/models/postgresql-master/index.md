PostgreSQL administration tool.

Manage your PostgreSQL databases with ease like a master. It is extremely useful when you want to manage multiple databases or you want to have multiple connections to a single database. Each database connection is running in a separate tab. Even better, it remembers the connection URIs so you can connect to your databases by simply one click.

The app provides modern graphical interface. It also includes a syntax highlighting SQL editor. You can also download tables and query results as CSV/JSON/XML.
