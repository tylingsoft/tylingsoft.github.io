# HTTP Server

HTTP server to host your static websites. It supports up to 6 websites, each running on an unique port.

It's a lifesaver for frontend developers. Testing your HTML pages has never been so easy! You can use this app to test your website locally before you deploy it to a production server.

I know there are lots of command line tools which behave like an HTTP server. But it is annoying to open and keep lots of terminal windows. And several mouse clicks are MUCH faster than dozens of keyboard typings. What's more, this app remembers where your websites are so you can serve them by simply one click.
